## Introduction

Online quizzes can be used to test one's knowledge of specific content. The foundation of the coding quiz, in particular, utilizes html as the structure of the quiz, CSS to style the content and cosmetics of the quiz page, and JavaScript to input the functionality of the website to be able to answer the subsequent questions by gathering inputs through a series of prompts and user answers. JavaScript also enables the website to input a timer that monitors the pace of the bootcamp student taking the quiz, and the length of time it takes for the bootcamp student to complete the quiz impacts their overall score in the ranking system. The coding quiz works by clicking the start button, which prompts a starting timer that presents the first question, procedes to the second question based off of the answer and inputs of the user, and procedes to the third question based off of the answer and inputs of the user. When a question is answered incorrectly, time is subtracted from the clock. The quiz ends when all questions have been answered or when the timer reaches a time of 0. Then the user saves their score by inputting and submitting their initials. 

## Usage
1. Open the coding quiz URL in browser.
2. Follow along the quiz and answer the subsequent questions by choosing the correct answer. 
3. Record initials at the end of the quiz to populate high scores and compare with peers. 

## Configuration
