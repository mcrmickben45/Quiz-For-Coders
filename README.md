## Introduction

Online quizzes serve as valuable tools for assessing one's knowledge on specific topics. The coding quiz, in particular, relies on HTML for structural elements, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality. JavaScript facilitates question prompts, user input gathering, and the implementation of a timer, influencing the overall score in the ranking system. The quiz begins by clicking the start button, initiating a timer and presenting questions based on user responses. Incorrect answers lead to time deductions. The quiz concludes when all questions are answered or the timer reaches zero, allowing users to save their scores by entering and submitting their initials.

## Usage
1. Open the coding quiz URL in browser.
2. Follow along the quiz and answer the subsequent questions by choosing the correct answer. 
3. Record initials at the end of the quiz to populate high scores and compare with peers. 

## Configuration
Built using:
- HTML
